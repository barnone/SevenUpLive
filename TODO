FEATURES

-External controller to start/stop recording
- Load Scales from XML Files
- Ability to load a melodizer scales from an XML file and have it associated with a custom name and appear in the pick list. 
- XML improvements like XML validation of patches...pretty printing of XML so it is easier to edit.
- Controller Page
- Ability to send all control changes when moving between control pages.
- More quantization options
	Ability to start/stop loops and loop recorder slot quantized to step or bar. 
	Use the navcol start/stop and masterizer start/stop buttons only. Still allow triggering of loop steps unquantized. If launching from quantized button then chokes are also quantized.
- Mute capabilities + Sub Mixing of Loop Tracks  

BUGS
- When loading a patch, patternizers do not update their UI until you move away from page and come back again
- SamplePatchPack.xml is not really a patch pack. Needs to be updated.
- Check "NextPatch" clip in template...It was sending an F3 instead of the F4 needed to change the patch. 
- There was a bug report that loop pattern recorder was not replaying loops that used choke groups properly. This may have to do
which where new notes are triggered or not depending on loop mode. - Fixed 2.0.5
- Bug in melodizer code where the first note may not be played directly after recording a sequence and another note is held down
- Bug reported where pattern slots in Masterizer are not clearer when the pattern is dropped (recorded as empty) in a Melodizer. - FIXED 1.4 beta 4
- Send note OFFS when switching patches mid-stride
- Tilt not working with gs128 - Fixed 2.0.5

v2.0 MFL Specific

FEATURES
- Move loop type/length/chop group mapping to the individual looper device (to allow for multiple looper devices in the future)
- Create a "resampler" object that would be audio effect that captures sound in real time and loads it into a designated looper slot in real time.  This would require us to create our own custom Simpler object that is hooked into this. 
- Rename all references from SevenUp to 7up
- SevenUpClip very inefficient as polls live set for new or moved clips. Must instead use observers or other mechanism to use less resources. - Fixed 2.0.5
-Add a check to make sure user installed the java classes correctly and provide output in either the max window or in the UI to notify the user
