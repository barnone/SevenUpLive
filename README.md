Installing SevenUpLive

1. You MUST have Live 8.2.2+ and Max For Live (MAX ver 5.1.8+) to run SevenUp 2.0.5 and greater.
2.0.5 is compatible with MAX6+ now as well. (32 bit versions only at the moment due to zeroconf plugin 32bit only) TODO: need 64 bit version

2. Copy all jar files in the ./supporting folder into your MAX Java classpath.
The easiest way to do this is to copy them directly into the MAX distribution. 
For example: 

(Mac) /Applications/Max5/Cycling\ '74/java/lib
(PC) C:\Program Files\Cycling '74\Max 5.0\Cycling '74\java\lib

To get started, follow the instructions in the documentation here.
