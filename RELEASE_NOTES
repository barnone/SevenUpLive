v2.0.5

7up supports MAX5 and MAX6 now.

- Two versions of SevenUpCore. SevenUpCore from 2.0.4 is now SevenUpCoreClassic
and has old style connection dialog. This version support use with Monomeserial,
and all routers that were designed to work with v1 protocol. New SevenUpCore is 
designed to work with serialosc and v2 protocol. You need to install zeroconf MAX
externals for your platform first. This connection is very slick as monomes are 
autodetected on the network and configured automatically including detection of
monome size. Rotation, intensity can be altered on the fly while running.

- Added velocity support to Melodizers
On melodizer 1, midi input to ch9 on track that SevenUpCore is in will record 
notes to pattern recorders. Velocity will now be recorded as well. 

There are three custom OSC protocol messages specific to 7up and not included 
in the monome osc protocol.

For v1 classic protocol these are

/refresh - Force 7up to redraw the entire surface, rather than the 
standard draw mode that only redraws what has changed. This was needed for 
manta support, because we move the draw window and need a way to force a full
redraw.

Multi-level led support for v2 monomes. Monomes that support multi-intensity leds 
can use this mode which is very friendly on the bandwidth since it trades fast
blinks for led levels. Current pattern still fast blinks. Record enable still 
slow binks.

- Added Manta Support. Must have a v2 Manta with dual color leds. Choose mantav2 
from SevenUpCoreClassic pick list. Must drop Manta7up.amxd into your Live set 
somewhere. Choose "connect" to connect to the Manta first before starting 7up.

Tilt support added for serialosc

/xpress x y v - Same as /press but with extra param for velocity.
if you send osc button press messages to SevenUp and add an extra integer OSC 
param at the end, SevenUp will interpret this as velocity input. 
This is how the manta patch works, an app could also use an ARC or encoder 
to modify the velocity range and send this with button presses.

The messages are slightly different when using v2 serialosc protocol since the 
path look slightly different in v2 messages.
 
/grid/refresh
/grid/xkey x y v 

BUG FIXES

Fixed tilt support for gs128. For some reason the protocol type tags were 
different for the gs128. Anyway, it works now.

Fixed loop recorder bug where choke group interactions were not being properly 
recorded.

Fixed SevenUpCoreClass host/listen port configuration did not allow for ports 
above 9999. Now can go up to 400000.

Fixed clip launcher being a resource hog by not polling anymore but using 
observers instead.

Users wanted blink modes switched on clip launcher since fast blink was used for 
all inactive clips and that meant lots of blinking and almost unusable. So now
the fast blink is for playing and solid for not playing.
